# Team Lucey CS 190 Project
## Initial Setup
**(Recommended): Create and activate a virtual environment for this project.**

**Install required packages**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

***

In src folder, you will find R Markdown (.Rmd) files. These are essentially copies of any used jupyter notebooks without having all of the JSON output.

**To convert Rmd into a Jupyter notebook:**

`jupytext --to notebook notebook.md`

Example: `jupytext --to notebook DataCleaning.Rmd`
